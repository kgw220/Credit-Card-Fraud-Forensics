# Credit-Card-Fraud-Forensics
This project aims to take simulated transaction data (specifically from the U.S), and build various ML algorithms of the feature of whether the transaction was fraudulent or not.

I perform initial data wrangling for EDA with various python visualizations. After identifying the most important features, more data wrangling is done to remove
non-important features to avoid multi-collinearity, and I build 9 different models. I then analyze the performance of each model with a confusion matrix, 3 statistical metrics (precision, recall, and F-1 score), and a cumulative ROC/AUC plot at the end. 

This reposotory holds the raw Juypter Notebook file for this project, alongside a knitted PDF of the notebook alongside results for quick reference. I also briefly explain certain concepts in the notebook that may not be well known.
